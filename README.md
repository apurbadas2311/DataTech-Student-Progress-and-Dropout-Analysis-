Student Funnel Deep Dive: Optimizing Course Completion Rates
This repository contains the full analysis and dashboard for the Apurba DataTech course, tracking student progress, dropout rates, and time-to-completion metrics.
The analysis monitors 30 unique students through a 4-stage learning funnel: 

Enrolled, Level 1, Level 2, and Course Completed. The primary objective is to identify key drop-off points and measure performance differences between the BTech and BCom student cohorts. The insights derived are crucial for improving course structure, reducing attrition, and strategically allocating support resources.
The 

overall course completion rate is 23.33%.

üí° Key Findings & Features

The analysis provides a segmented view of student performance based on their educational background:

‚Ä¢	Overall Conversion Rate: 23.33% of all enrolled students completed the course.

‚Ä¢	Major Dropout Point: The highest dropout rate (46.67%) occurs between the Enrolled and Level 1 stages.

‚Ä¢	Completion Rate by Background:

o	BTech: Higher completion rate at 25.00%.

o	BCom: Lower completion rate at 20.00%.

‚Ä¢	Time to Completion:

o	BTech: Students complete the course faster, averaging 8.50 days.

o	BCom: Students take longer, averaging 10.50 days.

‚Ä¢	Visual Dashboard: Includes charts for Overall Student Funnel, Average Days Spent, and Background-wise Dropout Rates.

üíª Example Usage Scenario

A course designer wants to know which student group needs more accelerated content and which needs more time/support:

1.	They consult the Avg days to complete insight.

2.	They observe that BTech students are faster (8.50 days) and BCom students are slower (10.5 days).

3.	Action: The designer decides to introduce specialized support or supplementary materials for BCom students to help them keep pace and reduce their time-to-completion.
